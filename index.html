        Portal 2 is a 2011 puzzle-platform game developed by Valve for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's Steam service, while all retail editions were distributed by Electronic Arts. A port for the Nintendo Switch was included as part of Portal: Companion Collection.

            Additional game elements not featured in the original Portal include Thermal Discouragement Beams (lasers), Excursion Funnels (tractor beams), and Hard Light Bridges, all of which can be transmitted through portals.[2][6][7][8] Aerial Faith Plates catapult the player and objects through the air. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The player must disable sentient, lethal turrets or avoid their line of sight. The Weighted Storage Cube has been redesigned, and there are new types: Redirection Cubes, which have prismatic lenses that redirect laser beams, spherical Edgeless Safety Cubes, an antique version of the Weighted Storage Cube used in the underground levels, and a cube-turret hybrid created by Wheatley after taking control of Aperture.[2][9] The heart-decorated Weighted Companion Cube reappears briefly.

            <br>
            [10] Early demonstrations included Pneumatic Diversity Vents, shown to transport objects and transfer suction power through portals, but these do not appear in the final game.[2][9][11][12] The typical objective of a test chamber or level is to use the portal gun and provided gameplay elements to open a locked exit door and progress to the next chamber.
            Paint-like gels (which are dispensed from pipes and can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them.
            <br>
            <br>
            [2] Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface,[13] and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals.[14] Only one type of gel can affect a certain surface at a time. Some surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the surface or object to its normal state.
            In the cooperative campaign, two players can use the same console with a split screen, or can use a separate computer or console; Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 3 users can play with each other regardless of platform.[15][16]
            <br>
            <br>
            Both player-characters are robots equipped with independent portal guns, a portal pair placed by either player is usable by both.[2][8][17] Most chambers lack strict structure, and require players to use both sets of portals for laser or funnel redirection, launches, and other maneuvers.[18]
            <br>
            <br>
            The game provides voice communication between players, and online players can temporarily enter a split-screen view to help coordinate actions.[17] Players can "ping" to draw the other player's attention to walls or objects, start countdown timers for synchronized actions, and perform joint gestures such as waving or hugging.[2][7][18] The game tracks which chambers each player has completed and allows players to replay chambers they have completed with new partners.

            Portal 2's lead writer Erik Wolpaw estimates each campaign to be about six hours long.[3] Portal 2 contains in-game commentary from the game developers, writers, and artists. The commentary, which is unlocked per completed chapter, appears on node icons scattered through the chambers.[19] According to Valve, each of the single-player and cooperative campaigns is 2 to 2.5 times as long as the campaign in Portal, with the overall game five times as long.[5][7][20]
